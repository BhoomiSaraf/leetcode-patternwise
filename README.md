# LeetCode Pattern-Wise DSA Solutions (Java)

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems organized by
data structures and algorithmic patterns.  
The intent is to develop strong problem-solving skills by learning how to
identify and apply the correct pattern for a given problem.

## Why Pattern-Wise Practice

Solving problems by patterns helps in:
- Recognizing problem types quickly
- Avoiding brute-force approaches
- Improving consistency in interviews
- Building long-term intuition for DSA

 # Each folder contains:
- Java implementations of LeetCode problems related to the pattern
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining when and how the pattern is used

  ## Language and Tools
- Programming Language: Java
- Platform: LeetCode
- Version Control: Git and GitHub

---

## Objective
To systematically strengthen data structures and algorithms knowledge
and prepare effectively for software engineering interviews.

---

## Status
This repository is actively maintained and updated as I solve more problems.
